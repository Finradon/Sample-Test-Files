## Linear_Objectplacement_1

### Intent

This is a sample for linear placements along two alignment curves. The file contains 4962 objects representing 
railway thresholds (IfcBuildingElementProxy) and 88 objects representing masts (IfcBuildingElementProxy).
Linear placement, with which the objects are placed, is defined by the distance along 
the referenced curve (in this case IfcAlignmentCurve), the offset and the orientation. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon following other scenarios:
- none
