### Intent

This is a sample for local placements along two alignment curves. The file contains 4962 objects representing 
railway thresholds (IfcBuildingElementProxy). LocalPlacement is defined by threedimensional cartesian
coordinates which represent th location of the object within the space. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon following other scenarios:
- none

### Content

This scenario builds upon following scenarios:
- project structure
  - `IfcProject`
  - `IfcSite`
- default unit assignment
  - `IfcUnitAssignment`
  - `IfcSIUnit`
- alignment
  - `IfcAlignment`
- core spatial structure
  - `IfcProject`
  -  `IfcSite`
